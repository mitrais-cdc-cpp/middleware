How was the CppUnit library obtained statically (into a certain local folder)?

I. Background:
There is a need to run the unit test of an application on a machine without CppUnit library installed globally (at the machine level).
So, the library should be shipped along with the source code of the main app. During the compilation of the main app, the library is also called.


II. Technical steps:
The following steps will get the CppUnit library into a dedicated folder. That folder (including the content) then can be added into the main app source code as additional library.

1. Find and download the source code of the tool
https://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/files/cppunit/1.12.1/
cppunit-1.12.1.tar.gz

Note: The latest version on apt-get (when this article written) is 1.13.2-2.1

2. Extract the file into a new folder
3. Configure the compilation folder to the new folder also supply the LDFLAGS options, i.e. run the following command: 
./configure --prefix ~/output/cppunit-1.12.1/ LDFLAGS='-ldl'

Note: the LDFLAGS is to avoid error of DllPlugInTester

4. Call make
5. Call make install
6. See the output folder, there are 4 subfolders, i.e. bin, include, lib and share.
include folder contains all the header files.
lib folder contains the .so file

The folder structure and content (as shipped with this ReadMe) are the result of the steps above.
